Predicting Weekly Sales in Reliance 7-11 Superstores with 88% Accuracy using EDA ,Feature Engineering and  RFE
This project analyzes sales data from 711 superstores, employing advanced techniques such as feature engineering, outlier removal, and recursive feature elimination. Insights are gained through exploratory data analysis, revealing relationships between variables. By developing a linear regression model, weekly sales predictions are made with an accuracy of 88%. The project highlights feature selection for accurate predictions. Overall, this project offers valuable insights and a reliable predictive model for sales analysis in superstores.


#  Insights
### Targeted Marketing and Promotions:-
- We may spot patterns and trends that lead to increased sales by examining sales data by shop,
month, and working day/holiday. In order to increase sales, use this information to create
targeted marketing campaigns and specials for certain months or days. As an example, invest
greater resources to marketing initiatives throughout certain months if sales are typically
higher during those months.
### Inventory management:-
- We may improve your inventory management by understanding the sales distribution and
anomalies. We can make sure that there is enough stock available to fulfil customer demand
by determining peak sales periods. In addition, by looking at outliers, we may spot any odd
sales cycles and change the stock levels accordingly. Also be able to enhance efficiency and
save money by reducing stockouts and surplus inventory. 
### Monitoring sales by shop:-
- This may help us pinpoint the best-performing locations as well as understand the elements
that make them successful. Apply their plans and recommendations to underperforming
stores by using this information to learn from them. Find any outliers or abnormalities in
the sales for certain stores, and then look into the reasons why. We will be able to spread
profitable ideas throughout all of your locations.
### Focus on Key Drivers:-
- By doing a Recursive feature analysis, you may determine the variables that have the most
impact on sales. Put your efforts on improving these key drivers. Consider dedicating more
funds to enhancing particular product categories or promotions, for instance, if the study
reveals that they have a significant impact on sales.
### Sales Forecasting:-
- The projectâ€™s sales prediction model can be a useful tool for making future forecasts. Continually
improve and enhance the model using new information and user input. You can
make wise decisions regarding manufacturing, staff, and resource allocation with the help of
accurate sales forecasting.
